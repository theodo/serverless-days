    "mick-desc": "It was in London in 2010 that Mick discovered the coffee culture already very developed in the coffee shops of East London. While in Paris one often has to make do with burnt coffee at the brewery counters, the English, inspired by the Australians and New Zealanders, who are numerous in the City, are working hard to help coffee lovers discover the different origins and preparation methods. Passionate baristas and microbrewers make up a community convinced that coffee can be tasted for its notes and aromas as one does for wine in France. But it was a year-long trip to Latin America that finally convinced Mick to embark on the coffee adventure. Meeting with committed producers and visiting several plantations in Guatemala, Colombia, Peru and Brazil allowed him to discover the richness of the work done upstream. The variety of the processes of cultivation, harvesting, drying and pulping of the beans make the richness of coffee production. Each step has its impact on the final taste in the cup. In 2018, Mick's Coffee was born, thanks to the support of the Beans On Fire collective and the collaborative workshop that bears the same name in Paris' 20th arrondissement. An artisanal and respectful roasting of each origin: the goal being to reveal all the aromas and subtleties of each bean according to its origin but also the pulping process (Washed, Natural, Honey...) Mick chooses his coffees by working hand in hand with importers who are also passionate and who guarantee the traceability of the beans as well as fairness in terms of income for the small producers. Now it's up to you to discover the aromatic palette of coffees inspired by life's good moments. They are delivered free of charge by bicycle in Paris!"
