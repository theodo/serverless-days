description: What's it like switching from a small team using Ruby On Rails to a Big Company split into multiple tech teams keen on AWS and microservices when you have no engineer background ? This sounds like a big jump into the Ocean and I'm sharing the map I drew to navigate these troubled waters !
biographie: Juliette started learning to code three and a half years ago in a bootcamp. Before that she trained in political sciences and worked for a non-profit organization leading musical activities in schools. She found a new career vocation in her tech journey and she's in for a ride ! She's volunteering at Women On Rails to encourage and help women in their journey into tech ! Apart from code she likes reading, writing, DIY and recently got her hands on Legos.
