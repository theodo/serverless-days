title: "ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ Confidently Build Cloud-Native Applications with Serverless Integration Testing"
description: If there is one mantra for serverless, it's "Code is a Liability". But as code is replaced with services, the testing landscape changes too. Instead of unit tests, we need integration tests. In this talk we'll show how to build serverless integration tests with AWS Step Functions, Lambda and Pytest.
