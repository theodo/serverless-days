title: "ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ The future of Serverless: Isolates on the Edge"
description: |
  Cloudflare Workers enables deploying a serverless application instantly, from a developer's computer to the edge - as close as possible (tens of milliseconds!) to every internet user around the world. 
  This is made possible by running V8 isolates - the same engines powering Chrome, on Cloudflare's global CDN network, spanning 194+ data centers around the world. For end users this means blazing fast, always available applications due to the reduced latency of requests traveling around the globe, and no cold starts, due to the lightweight nature of isolates, as compared to containers. For developers this means more time spent writing code, and building features, rather than scaling and optimizing cloud configurations.
  This talk will cover the technology powering Cloudflare Workers, and how edge-based serverless is changing the web stack: from the evolution of JAMstack on the edge and edge-side rendering to IoT applications, and beyond!
