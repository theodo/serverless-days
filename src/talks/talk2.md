title: "ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ Lambda is dead; long live serverless!"
description:
  AWS Lambda started the serverless revolution when it launched in November 2014. However, like Flash, its initial utility is fading as the broader ecosystem evolves. As other serverless offerings appear and mature, what comes next? Will Lambda live on in its current form, or at all?
biographie:
  Rob, Head of Developer Advocacy at Fauna, has woven application development into his entire career, from time in the U.S. Army and U.S. Government to stints with the Big Four and Amazon Web Services. He has started his own company â€“ twice â€“ once providing consulting services and most recently with WorkFone, a SaaS startup providing virtual digital identities. Rob loves to build in public with cloud architectures, Node.js or Go, and all things serverless!
