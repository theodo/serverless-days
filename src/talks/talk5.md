title: "ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ Serverless Socializing: How I Built a Quick Multi-Player Serverless Game"
description: "Working with a fully remote team, it's been hard to develop some team camaraderie. To help with this, we played various multiplayer, cloud-based games! And of course, I tried to build my own. In this talk, we'll play the game and understand how it is built with a serverless architecture in mind!"
biographie: "Currently a Senior Developer Advocate for MongoDB, Adrienne Tacke is also a Filipina software engineer, speaker, published author of the book Coding for Kids: Python, and a LinkedIn Learning instructor who specializes in Cloud Development courses. Perhaps most important, however, is that she spends way too much money on desserts and ungodly amounts of time playing Cyberpunk 2077."
