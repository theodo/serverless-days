title: "ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ Advanced serverless messaging patterns for your applications"
description: "Using the right messaging patterns between your services can help with durability, availability, and reducing custom code. This talk shows how to use AWS services to build robust messaging patterns into the foundation of your application architecture.<br><br>
You can use Amazon SQS, Amazon SNS, and Amazon EventBridge to introduce fanout, queuing, and decoupling between your services. But you can also use these services in combinations to create powerful architectures that make your workloads scale.<br><br>
This talk explains when to use these advanced patterns and provides infrastructure as code templates you can use in your own applications. After this talk, you'll see how to take advantage of services and reduce the amount of custom code to maintain."
