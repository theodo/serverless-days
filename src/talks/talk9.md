title: "ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· The State of Serverless: 2021"
description: "Datadog has examined millions of functions run by thousands of companies over the past two years to understand how serverless is being used in the real world. For example, did you know that the average organisation runs 900 hours of Lambda a dayâ€”and that the average run-time per invocation has been cut in half over the past year? Or that 25% of CloudFront users have embraced serverless edge computing? Or that, perhaps more importantly, organisations are overspending on provisioned concurrency across the board? In this talk, weâ€™ll dive into our findings and explain the trendsâ€”and help you understand your current serverless posture, and future serverless strategy."

As a member of the Devopsdays Core team, he has had the privilege of speaking and keynoting at events around the world. Today, he is a Developer Advocate at Datadog, a role that mixes two of his great passions: measuring things, and talking about measuring things."
